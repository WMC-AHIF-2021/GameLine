## Our Project
  Why did we start this projekt? We decided to do this, because we wanted to see, how the early games looked liked. 
  Its also incredible how it all improved so much, compared to the games now. And GameLine is a website for the early games. 
  We show you how they looked like and what the task were. We also created our own game,
  which is linked at the top of the page. We also described 3 games, which were Ant Attack, Wolfensteiner3d and Unreal Tournament. 
  There are also a lot of more games, we want to show you in the future. The Website itself is structured with a linked description, 
  which are on top of the page and also the description of the programmer of the Webistes. Micheal and Samuel , we 2 created this Website.
  And the description is linked at the top of the page.
